## Test case strategy:-
Control flow graphs(graph based testing) with only control flow criteria.
Test cases are designed for edge coverage and for prime paths coverage.

## Testing Tools:-
JUnit: Available from http://junit.org/junit5/
Prime and Edge Paths Generator:- https://cs.gmu.edu:8443/offutt/coverage/GraphCoverage

## Contributions:-
Followed Pair Programming practice. Driver(programmer at the keyboard) and the Navigator(programmer actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction), in this case being T Tarun Reddy(IMT2019088) and K Yashovardhan Reddy(IMT2019097) kept swapping to distribute the workload to hasten the implementation and finish the project.
